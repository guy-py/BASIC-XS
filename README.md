# BASIC-XS

Heavily inspired by Apple Basic.
BASIC-XS is basicly Basic, the coding languige, but extra small (XS)

How to use:
  There are some commands like prnt, list, and more.
  print: print something
  input: return a user input
  rand: return a random number
  list: list every line of code
  exec: execute a single line of code
  run: run all lines of code
Example:

>>1 prnt 'there'  #line 1: print there
>>run  #run all of the lines
hello
there
>>exec 0 #run line 0 only
hello
>>list  #list all of the lines
0 prnt 'hello
1 prnt 'there'

Note that '#' doesn't work here.
